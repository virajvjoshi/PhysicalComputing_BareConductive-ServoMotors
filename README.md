# PhysicalComputing_BareConductive-ServoMotors
Bare Conductive touch board in order to trigger servo motors.

** Connecting a Bare Conductive Touch board to Servo Motors**
I was commissioned to work at Chris Lefteri Design Ltd. with Matteo Bandi, on a project for a German Automotive Manufacturer. I worked in the capacities of Industrial Design and Physical Computing for this hands on project.

This application explores Arduino for:
01. Servo Motor Library
02. MPR121 Library for Bare Conductive Board
